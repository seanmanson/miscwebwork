# miscwebwork

Some miscellaneous PHP, HTML, CSS, Javascript work I did for INFS3202 at UQ in 2015.

We were given weekly website creation tasks, and I had to use a variety of web
technologies to achieve them in a short period of time. The assignment specifications
are included for reference.

Technologies included HTML5, CSS, PHP, Javascript, JQuery, MySQL and even JSP.
The final prac involved using a Microsoft Azure database solution as well.
